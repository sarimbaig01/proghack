    <h1> Problem 3.3 Stock Analysis by First Rises</h1>
        <section class="statement">
            <p>While computing the maximum rise in a stock price is useful for analysis, it does not accurately capture the pattern of price rises. A single rise in value could be an outlier.</p>

            <p>A better way to capture the pattern of price rises is to compute, for each price point, the first subsequent rise in its value. Once these rises have been computed for each price point, further analysis can be performed to study the stock behavior more thoroughly.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The problem:</strong> For each price of the stock, we compute the first rise in its value; i.e., for each \( i \), we compute <code>first_rise[i] = prices[j] - prices[i]</code>, where \( j \) is the first index after \( i \) for which <code>prices[j] &gt; prices[i]</code>.</p>
            
            <p>If no such \( j \) exists for an \( i \), then <code>first_rise[i] = -1</code>. Consequently, <code>first_rise[n-1] = -1</code> (where \( n \) is the length of the input).</p>

            <p>Firgure 1 below shows a plot of price values and the first rises in their values (the red arrows).</p>

                        <figcaption>Figure 1: Visual representation of the time series price data and the first rises in their values. The first_rise values (indicated by arrows) are: [4, 14, 92, 15, 31, 82, 19, -1, 13, -1]. No arrows are shown corresponding to the -1 values in first_rise.</figcaption>

            <h3>Code</h3>
            <p>The simple method to compute all first rises checks for each point \( i \), the points \( j > i \) corresponding to the first increase in price value after \( i \). As a warm-up, implement the following function stub using this straightforward approach.</p>

            <div class="code-container" data-filename="./py/firstrises1.py">
                <pre><code class="language-python" id="py-code1">
                </code></pre>
             </div>

            <h3>Test your code</h3>    
            <p>Use the following main to test your function:</p>
                <div class="code-container" data-filename="./py/firstrise2.py">
                <pre><code class="language-python" id="py-code3">
                </code></pre>
            </div>
           
            <h3>A better approach</h3>
            <p>Now <strong>refine your method such that algorithm makes only a single pass through the prices.</strong></p>
            <p>You can use a stack for this purpose.</p>

            <h4>Hint on how to use a stack</h4>
            <p>todo: hint here... </p>

            <p>Implement the first_rises function using the refined approach. Use the same main as above to test your code.</p>
