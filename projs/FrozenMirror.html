    <h1> Problem 1.1 Mirror with Gaps </h1>
        <section class="statement">
            <p>Consider list of integer values representing an image (usually this would be a two-deimensional grid, but for this problem we consider only one dimension). The image is to be reflected by a peculiar kind of mirror: some parts of the mirror are frozen, i.e, these parts are not mirrored but retain their place. When the image is mirrored, all elements in the list are reversed except the elements at the positions corresponding to the frozen parts of the mirror, which retain their original places and are not reversed.</p>
            <p>To achieve this peculiar mirrored effect, you need to reverse the contents of the list (the original list in-place, i.e., not using another list in the process) while keeping the elements at the frozen indices unchanged. The frozen indices are provided separately in the input.</p>

            <h3>Examples of inputs and outputs:</h3>

            Some example inputs and their corresponding outputs are shown below.
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Input:</strong> image = [5, 3, 2, 6, 4, 0, 11, 9, -7, 13]</p>
                    <p> frozen indices = [0, 2, 4, 6]</p>
                    <p><strong>Output:</strong> [5, 13, <span style="color: blue;">2</span>, -7, <span style="color: blue;">4</span>, 9, <span style="color: blue;">11</span>, 0, 6, 3]</p>
                    <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> All elements except the ones appearing on frozen indices (shown in blue here) have been reversed in order.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
             
            <p>Below is a visual representation of the input and output transformation:</p>
            <img src="./img/FrozenMirror1.png" width="650" height="180">
            <p>In the visual, the frozen elements (in blue) retain their positions while the rest of the elements are reversed.</p>
    
            
            <h3>Python code</h3>
            <p>Implement the following function stub: </p>
            <div class="code-container" data-filename="./py/fmirror1.py">
                <pre><code class="language-python" id="py-code">
                </code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>Use the following main to test your function: </p>
            <div class="code-container" data-filename="./py/fmirror2.py">
                <pre><code class="language-python" id="py-code">
                </code></pre>
            </div>
            
            <!--<p><code>void mirrorImage(std::vector&lt;int&gt;& image, const std::vector&lt;int&gt;& frozenIndices);</code></p>-->
    
        </section>
      </div>
</body>
