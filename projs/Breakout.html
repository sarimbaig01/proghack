            <p><a href="https://atari.com/pages/breakout" target="_blank"> Breakout </a> is a classic arcade game developed and published by Atari, Inc. in 1976. The game involves a player controlling a paddle to bounce a ball against a wall of bricks, with the objective of breaking all the bricks without letting the ball fall off the screen. As a foundational game in the video game industry, Breakout has inspired countless variations and remains a popular example of early arcade gaming.</p>

            <p>Building on the tasks you have already completed in Contained Bounce, you can now proceed to build Breakout. You have already implemented basic mechanics such as moving the paddle, bouncing the ball off the walls, and detecting collisions with the paddle. With these fundamentals in place, the next steps involve adding bricks to the game, detecting collisions between the ball and the bricks, and updating the game state to reflect broken bricks. This progression will allow you to transform Contained Bounce into a fully functional Breakout game.</p>
