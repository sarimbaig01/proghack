        <p>We often need to shuffle the songs in the playlist, in other words, randomize their order. For a list of n songs, with n! possible orders, an ideal shuffle would ensure that each order occurs with the probability 1/n!. There are several ways of doing this; for example, one way would be to generate a random key corresponding to each song, then sort the songs in order of these keys. This method would require using a sorting method.</p>
        <p>However, this can be accomplished faster, in time linear on the size of the input, by using other shuffling methods, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle">Fisher-Yates shuffle</a>. Implement the Fisher-Yates method to shuffle the playlist.</p>
        <p>The prototype of the function to be written is:</p>
        <code>void shufflePlaylist(std::vector<char>& data, std::vector<int>& links, int& start);</code>
