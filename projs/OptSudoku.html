        <h1>Problem 6.3 Optimize the Sudoku Solver</h1>
        <section class="statement">
            <div class="intro" id="intro">
                <p>
                    The basic recursive Sudoku solver checks available numbers for each empty cell by iterating over all
                    values from \( 1 \) to \( 9 \)
                    and validating them against the row, column, and 3×3 sub-grid. This process can be optimized using
                    the <code>FastSet</code> class
                    to store and manipulate allowed numbers efficiently.
                </p>

                <h3>How to use FastSet?</h3>

                <p>
                    Instead of looping over all possible numbers for a given cell, we can maintain three
                    arrays of <code>FastSet</code> objects:
                    <code>row[9]</code>, <code>col[9]</code>, and <code>box[9]</code>, where each array contains 9
                    <code>FastSet</code> instances.
                    Here, <code>row[i]</code> tracks numbers used in row <code>i</code>, <code>col[j]</code> tracks
                    numbers used in column <code>j</code>,
                    and <code>box[b]</code> tracks numbers used in the 3×3 sub-grid indexed by <code>b</code>.
                    Each <code>FastSet</code> efficiently stores which numbers (1-9) are already placed in its
                    corresponding region.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At first glance, this seems like a lot of extra storage, but we are using only 243 bits, which means
                    31 bytes, or in other words, fewer than 8 integers!
                </p>

                <h3>Operations</h3>

                <p>Instead of iterating through numbers 1 to 9, searching for a valid one by performing separate
                    validity checks, we can do this quickly using <code>FastSet</code>.</p>

                <h4>Finding available numbers quickly in a single operation</h4>
                <p>
                    To determine the valid numbers for an empty cell at \( (i, j) \), we compute:
                    \[
                    \text{allowed} = \sim(\text{row}[i] \cup \text{col}[j] \cup \text{box}[b])
                    \]
                    using bitwise operations. This represents all numbers that are still available for placement.
                </p>

                <h4>Extracting the smallest of the available numbers in a single operation</h4>
                <p>
                    Instead of iterating through numbers 1 to 9, we can extract the smallest available number
                    efficiently using a bitwise operation,
                    such as counting the position of the lowest set bit. To do this most efficiently, see how the
                    built-in function <code>__builtin_ctz()</code> works. (Note: <code>__builtin_ctz()</code> is a
                    compiler built-in
                    function which runs in O(1) time because it is mapped directly to a single CPU instruction on most
                    modern processors.)
                </p>

                <h4>Placement and removal</h4>
                <p>
                    When placing a number, update the corresponding <code>FastSet</code> objects using
                    <code>insert()</code>. When backtracking, remove the number using <code>remove()</code>.
                </p>

                <h4>Overall benefits</h4>
                <p>
                    Using <code>FastSet</code> allows us to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce unnecessary iterations over digits 1-9 and comparisons across rows, columns, and grids.
                    </li>
                    <li>Improve cache efficiency with compact storage.</li>
                    <li>Optimize code by using bitwise operators, which avoid branching (unlike comparison operators), preventing CPU stalls and minimizing
                        pipeline flushes at the assembly level.</li>
                </ul>

                This results in a significantly faster recursive solver without changing the fundamental backtracking
                logic.
