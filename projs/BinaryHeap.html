                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>A <strong>binary heap</strong> is a complete binary tree stored as a vector, where each parent node
                    follows a specific order relation with its children. In a <strong>Min-Heap</strong>, the parent
                    always has a smaller value than its children, ensuring efficient retrieval of the smallest element
                    in \(O(\log N)\) time.</p>

                <p>Binary heaps are widely used in:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Priority queues</strong> (e.g., scheduling tasks, network packet buffering)</li>
                    <li><strong>Graph algorithms</strong> (e.g., Dijkstra’s shortest path)</li>
                    <li><strong>Heap sort</strong> (efficient sorting algorithm)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Figure 1 below shows an example of a Min-Heap. See the caption for more detail.</p>

                <div class="img-container">

                        <figcaption>Figure 1: The tree interpretation of a binary Min-Heap. (Image

                    </figure>
                </div>

                <p>This tree in Figure 1 corresponds to the vector:
                    <strong><code>[4, 4, 6, 11, 8, 6, 11, 13, 12, 20, 9]</code></strong>.
                </p>
                <p> Below each node in Figure 1 is the index of the value in that node in the corresponding vector. Note
                    that indices begin from 1. This is a convention followed in theoretical descriptions of
                    binary heaps.</p>

                <h3>Structure of the heap tree</h3>
                <p>The structure of the tree is encoded by three simple relationships, given below. For a given node \(
                    i \), its left child is found at \( 2i \), the right child at \( 2i + 1 \), and the parent of \( i
                    \) is found at \( \frac{i}{2} \).</p>
                <p>
                    \[
                    \text{Left child of } i: \quad 2i
                    \]
                    \[
                    \text{Right child of } i: \quad 2i + 1
                    \]
                    \[
                    \text{Parent of } i: \quad \frac{i}{2}
                    \]
                </p>
                <p>The type of tree shown in Figure 1 is called a <strong>complete tree</strong>. This is a tree in
                    which all levels,
                    except possibly the last level, are full (i.e., they are not missing any nodes). The last level may
                    not be full; however, the nodes in it must be aligned to the left, meaning there are no gaps between
                    nodes.</p>


                <div class="math1" id="math1">
                    <fieldset>
                        <legend>Height of a complete binary tree</legend>
                        <p>A perfect binary tree is a complete binary tree whose last level is full. The number of nodes
                            \( N \) of a complete binary tree of height \( h \) (assuming \( h \geq 1 \)) can be bounded
                            by the number of nodes in a perfect binary tree of height \( h-1 \) as follows:</p>
                        <p>
                            \[
                            2^0 + 2^1 + \ldots + 2^{h-1} < N \] </p>

                                <p>
                                    \[
                                    \implies 2^h - 1 < N \] </p>

                                        <p>
                                            \[
                                            \implies h < \log_2(N + 1) \] </p>
                                                <p>Hence, for a binary heap with \( N \) elements, the height of the
                                                    heap tree is no more than \( \log_2(N + 1) \).</p>
                                                <p>This implies that any heap operation that traverses a path in the
                                                    tree has a time complexity proportional to \( \log_2(N) \).</p>

                    <p>A binary heap (in this case a Min-Heap) is required to maintain two properties at all times:</p>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Shape property:</strong> The heap must always be a complete binary tree.</li>

                            than or equal to the values in its child nodes (if they exist), i.e., the nodes at \( 2i \)
                            and \( 2i + 1 \). There is no order constraint among sibling nodes, however.</li>

                    <h2>Task 1: Print the heap tree</h2>
                    <p>As we implement a binary heap, it will be useful to be able to view the data in the vector as the
                        logical heap tree. We need to write a function called <code>printHeap</code> to do this for us.
                        Use the provided main to test your implementation.</p>
                    <div class="code-container" data-filename="./cpp/binh1.cpp">

                    </div>
                    <p>Provide a full implementation for this function. The function should be able to print the heap in
                        a format that, even though not completely tree-like, makes it easier to read the tree structure.
                    </p>
                    <p>For example, for the vector: <strong> [4, 4, 6, 11, 8, 6, 11, 13, 12, 20, 9, 6, 19, 13]
                        </strong>, the tree could be printed as:</p>
                    <p><strong>[4]<br>
                            [4,6]<br>
                            [11,8][6,11]<br>
                            [13,12][20,9][6,19][13]</strong></p>
                    <p>The function prints one level per line. It uses square brackets to enclose siblings at each level
                        (single values appear within brackets when they have no siblings) and siblings are separated by
                        commas. There are no spaces.</p>

                    <h2>Task 2: heapifyDown and heapifyUp</h2>
                    <p>One of the fundamental operations required to maintain a binary min-heap is called heapify. Its
                        task may be described as follows:</p>
                    <p>Given a binary min heap, of valid shape, and the values of all but one node \( i \) in the
                        correct place according to the order property, move the value at \( i \) to its correct place
                        according to the order property, while maintaining the shape of the heap.</p>
                    <p>In the context of heapify, the value at \( i \) may violate the order property in one of two
                        possible ways: (1) the value at \( i \) is greater than the value of a child of \( i \), or (2)
                        the value at \( i \) is smaller than its parent.</p>
                    <p>The method used to resolve (1) is called heapify down, and the method to resolve (2) is heapify
                        up.</p>

                        <h3>heapifyDown</h3>
                        <p>Figure 2 below shows the action of heapifyDown. We begin with a properly shaped heap in which
                            one node, at the root in this case, contains a value that is greater than a child's value
                            (both children's values in this case). The algorithm proceeds by moving this value down the
                            heap, one level at a time, using the following rules:</p>
                        <p><strong>Case 1:</strong> If the node at \( i \) has only one child \( j \), and the value at
                            \( i \) is greater than the value at \( j \): swap the value at \( i \) with the value at \(
                            j \). Set \( i \) to \( j \) and repeat.</p>
                        <p><strong>Case 2:</strong> If the node at \( i \) has two children \( j \) and \( k \), and the
                            value at \( j \) is less than or equal to the value at \( k \) and less than the value at \(
                            i \): swap the value at \( i \) with the value at \( j \). Set \( i \) to \( j \) and
                            repeat.</p>
                        <p><strong>Case 3:</strong> If \( i \) has no children, or the value at \( i \) is less than or
                            equal to the values at the children, STOP.</p>

                            heap, and
                            get the minimum element. Given the way the heap is designed, the last task is quite simple:

                            return the value at the root.</p>

                            Next, pop back the last element from the vector.
                            Then, call <code>heapifyDown</code> on the root node.</p>

                            \log_2 N \) time, where \( c &gt; 0 \) is a constant. However, this can be accomplished in
                            only \(
                            \approx d \times N \) time, where \( d &gt; 0 \) is a constant, by repeatedly applying the
                            <code>heapifyDown</code> method, starting from the node at position \( N/2 \) and proceeding
                            all the
                            way to the node at the root.
                        </p>

                        <p>Intuitively: since the cost of <code>heapifyDown</code> depends on the height of the node
                            where it is
                            called, and since most nodes in a binary tree are at lower heights (much less than \( \log_2
                            N \)),
                            the overall time of \( N/2 \) calls to <code>heapifyDown</code> turns out to be
                            approximately \( N
                            \) rather than \( N \log_2 N \). You might need to consult an algorithms book for a detailed
                            mathematical analysis of the running time.</p>

                        <p>Before implementing the function, try the method on a random set of values to convince
                            yourself that
                            it works.</p>-->
