            <p>Imagine a network host receiving packets at hundreds of thousands per second. Due to the nature of network communication, some packets might be delivered out of order. We know that the out-of-order packets are only within a span of <code>N</code> consecutive sequence numbers. The host needs to maintain a buffer of the last <code>N</code> received packets and retrieve packets from the buffer based on the sequence number (smallest sequence number first to ensure ordered delivery). The buffer should provide the ability to find and remove the packet with the smallest sequence number efficiently, specifically, in around 
\[
\log_2 N
\]
 (or simply <code>lgN</code>) operations. This problem presents an ideal application for a data structure known as a <strong>binary Min-Heap</strong>.</p>

            <p>Physically, a binary heap is stored as a vector; however, it is interpreted as a tree. The index numbers of the vector elements are mapped to the nodes of the logical tree. Typically, in theory, the vector is assumed to begin from index 1; however, in practical implementations, index 0 might be considered the first element. In our description here, we will follow the convention of considering the element at index 1 as the root of the tree. The situation is depicted in Figure 1 below.</p>

            <p>The structure of the tree is encoded in three simple relationships, given below. For a given node \( i \), its left child is found at \( 2i \), the right child at \( 2i + 1 \), and the parent of \( i \) is found at \( \frac{i}{2} \).</p>

                    \[
                    \text{Right child of } i: \quad 2i + 1

            <p>The type of tree shown in Figure 1 is called a complete tree. This is a tree in which all levels, except possibly the last level, are full (i.e., they are not missing any nodes). The last level may not be full; however, the nodes in it must be aligned to the left, meaning there are no gaps between nodes.</p>

                <legend>Height of a complete binary tree</legend>
                <p>If \( N \) is the number of nodes in the heap and \( h \) is the height of the tree, then the total number of nodes in a complete binary tree can be expressed as a geometric series:</p>
                <p>\[
                N = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \dots + 2^h
                \]</p>
                <p>This series sums to:</p>
                <p>\[
                N = 2^{h+1} - 1
                \]</p>
                <p>\[
                \Rightarrow N + 1 = 2^{h+1}
                \]</p>
                <p>\[
                \Rightarrow h + 1 = \log_2(N + 1)
                \]</p>
                <p>\[
                \Rightarrow h = \log_2(N + 1) - 1
                \]</p>
                <p>This means that any operation on the heap that requires traversing a path from the root to a leaf (or vice versa) will take a constant multiple of \( \log_2(N) \) basic operations to complete.</p>

            <h3>The shape and order properties</h3>
            <p>A binary heap is required to maintain two properties at all times: the shape property and the order property. The <strong>shape property</strong> simply requires the heap to always be a complete binary tree. The <strong>order property</strong> requires that for any node <code>i</code>, the value at <code>i</code> must be less than or equal to the values in its child nodes (if they exist), i.e., the nodes at <code>2i</code> and <code>2i + 1</code>. There is no order constraint among sibling nodes, however.</p>
