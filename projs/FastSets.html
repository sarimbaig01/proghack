        <h1>Problem 6.2 Fast Sets Using Bit Vectors</h1>

        <section class="statement">
            <h2 class="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p> In this problem, you will implement a <code>FastSet</code> class using a bit vector.
                A FastSet allows efficient storage and lookup of numbers from a given range <code>[0, N]</code>.
                Unlike traditional data structures such as hash tables or arrays, a bit vector provides a
                space-efficient and cache-friendly way to store and operate on sets of numbers.</p>

            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>Implement a C++ class <code>FastSet</code> that supports the following set operations:</p>

            <ul>
                <li> Insert an element into the set. </li>
                <li> Remove an element from the set. </li>
                <li> Compute the union of two sets. </li>
                <li> Compute the intersection of two sets. </li>
                <li> Check if an element is a member of the set. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>
                A FastSet is implemented using a bit vector, where each number <code>x</code> is represented
                by setting the bit at index <code>x</code>. This allows for O(1) insertions, deletions, and lookups.
            </p>

            <h4>Union and intersection of two sets</h4>
            <p>
                The union of two sets \( A \) and \( B \) results in a set containing all elements that are in
                either \( A \) or \( B \). This can be computed using a bitwise OR operation:
            </p>
            \[
            A \cup B = A \ | \ B
            \]
            <p>
                In terms of bit vectors, we iterate over each block of 32-bit integers and apply the OR operation:
            </p>
            \[
            \text{result}[i] = A[i] \ | \ B[i]
            \]
            <p>
                This operation runs in O(N/32) = O(N) time and is much faster than a traditional array-based
                implementation which would require multiple passes of the array.
            </p>

            <p>Similarly, you can implement other set operations efficiently.</p>

            <p>The following code contains the class definition (to be implemented by you) and a main function for
                testing.</p>
