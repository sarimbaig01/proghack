            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                We consider a network server that receives binary identifiers in the form of \(0/1\) strings, each
                of length \(d\), from up to \(2^d\) communicating machines.</p>
            <p> These identifiers may arrive in large quantities, often repeatedly from the same machine. To
                analyze the communication behavior of each machine
                effectively, it is important to first sort the received data by machine identifiers.</p>
            <p>Sorting enables efficient organization of the data associated with the identifiers. This may further
                enable the server to detect patterns, count interactions, and identify anomalies or
                irregularities in communication behavior.
            </p>

            <h3>Problem definition</h3>
            <p>
                We are given a vector <code>identifiers</code> of \(N\) binary strings, where each string is of fixed
                length \(d\). The task is to sort the strings in <strong>non-decreasing order of the binary numbers they
                    represent</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Input:</strong> identifiers = {"100", "110", "101", "110", "000", "101"}<br>
                <strong>Output:</strong> identifiers = {"000", "100", "101", "101", "110", "110"}
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Important Notes:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>All strings in the vector <code>identifiers</code> have the same length \(d\).</li>
                <li>The number of identifiers, \(N\), can be any positive integer. (\(N\)is potentially much larger than \(d\)).
                </li>
                <li>The same identifier may repeat any number of times in <code>identifiers</code>.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <h3>Implementation 1: Sorting using repeated selection (slow)</h3>
            <p>
                One of the simplest sorting algorithms works as follows:
            </p>

            <div class="text-box">
                <p><strong>Sorting by Repeated Selection</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Traverse through the elements (strings, in this case) of the vector, and for each element:
                <ul>
                    <li>Find the smallest element from the current position to the end of the vector.</li>
                    <li> Swap the current element with the smallest element.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </div>


            <p>Let's begin by implementing this simple method in C++. The following code provides an empty sorting
                function (to be implemented by you), and a main that tests it.</p>
            <div class="code-container" data-filename="./cpp/bin_str1.cpp">
                <pre><code class="language-cpp" id="cpp-code1">
                </code></pre>
            </div>

            <h3>Implementation 2: Sorting by digits, using auxiliary storage (fast)</h3>
            <p>
                This implementation sorts identifiers by exploiting their \(0/1\) structure.
            </p>

            <p>It uses one digit position at a time as the sorting criterion.</p>

            <p>The method is shown in Figure 1 below. Please take a careful look at how it works.</p>

            <div class="img-container">
                <figure class="left-aligned">
                    <img src="./img/SortingByDigits.png" width="800" height="700">
                    <figcaption>Figure 1: The working of the digit-by-digit sorting method. On each step, the output of
                        the previous step is sorted based on the value of the next digit (moving from the least to most
                        significant digit).</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>

            <p> Following is a brief description of the method. The description is intentionally brief, and not all
                implementation details are provided. However, breaking the task into smaller functions can simplify the
                implementation. </p>

            <p>A key point is that if two strings \(x\)
                and \(y\) have the same digit at any step, their relative order from the previous step must be
                preserved.
                This is critical for the method to work correctly.
            </p>

            <div class="text-box">
                <p><strong>Sorting Digit-by-Digit</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Traverse through the \(d\) digit positions of the \(0/1\) strings from the least significant to
                    the most significant digit position, and for each position:
                <ul class="none">
                    <li>Move all strings with a \(0\) at that position above the strings with a \(1\) at that position.
                    </li>
                    <li>(Preserve the relative order of strings that have the same digit (0 or 1) at the current
                        position.)</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </div>

            <fieldset>
                <legend>Comparison: Repeated Selection vs. Digit-by-Digit Sorting</legend>
                <p>
                    This comparison highlights how the digit-by-digit method is faster than repeated selection for
                    sorting \(N\) identifiers (binary strings) of length \(d\).</p>

                <p> The number of strings \(N\) is exponential in terms of \(d\), as there are \(2^d\) possible binary
                    strings of length \(d\). Furthermore, strings can repeat, so \(N\) can greatly exceed \(2^d\),
                    making \(N\) much larger than \(d\) in typical cases.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The repeated selection method takes time proportional to \(N^2 \cdot d\), as it repeatedly scans the
                    unsorted portion of the strings to find the smallest, which involves comparing all pairs of strings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The digit-by-digit method takes time proportional to \(d^2 \cdot N\). At each of the \(d\) digit
                    positions, an additional cost of \(d \cdot N\) arises due to copying or processing the strings while
                    grouping or rearranging them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, consider sorting 1000 8-digit strings. The repeated selection method will require
                    approximately \(N^2 \cdot d = 1000^2 \cdot 8 = 8,000,000\) basic operations. In contrast, the
                    digit-by-digit method will require approximately \(d^2 \cdot N = 8^2 \cdot 1000 = 64,000\) basic
                    operations, making it significantly faster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The trade-off for the digit-by-digit method is the use of auxiliary storage to group strings during
                    intermediate steps.
                </p>
            </fieldset>

            <p>Finally, implement the digit-by-digit method in C++. The following code provides an empty sorting
                function (to be implemented by you). Use the same main as above to test your function. </p>
