            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Sudoku is a puzzle game played on a 9x9 board, divided into nine 3x3 subgrids. The goal is to fill the board with digits from 1 to 9 so that each digit appears exactly once in every row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. The puzzle begins with some cells already filled, and the player's task is to fill in the empty cells while following these rules, ensuring no repetition of digits in any row, column, or subgrid.</p>

            <p>For our purposes, each cell on the board will either contain a digit from 1 to 9 or a '.' representing an empty cell. We aim to write a recursive program that receives a partially filled initial state and attempts to reach a fully filled final state that satisfies all the Sudoku rules.</p>

                <legend>Some terminology</legend>
            
                <p><strong>Solution Search Space:</strong> 
                The solution search space is the set of all possible configurations that could solve a problem. In Sudoku, it includes every potential way to fill the grid with digits 1-9, regardless of whether the configurations follow the Sudoku rules.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Exhaustive Search:</strong> 
                Exhaustive search explores all possible options within the solution search space to find a solution. For Sudoku, this involves trying every combination of numbers until a valid solution is found, but it can be time-consuming due to the large number of possibilities. Typical applications of exhaustive search include solving puzzles like Sudoku, generating permutations and combinations, and finding solutions to the traveling salesman problem.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Backtracking:</strong> 
                Backtracking is a recursive technique that explores possible solutions by making choices and undoing them if they lead to dead ends. In Sudoku, backtracking places a number in a cell and, if it leads to an invalid configuration, reverses the decision and tries a different number. It's a core part of how recursive algorithms efficiently navigate large solution spaces.</p>

              <h2>Task 1: Solve a 9x9 Sudoku board</h2>
              <p>Our first goal is to write a recursive exhaustive search algorith to find a solution to a partially filled Sudoku board.</p>
              <h3>Brief explanation of the algorithm:</h3>
              <p>The algorithm works by recursively attempting to place a valid digit in each empty cell. It starts from the first empty cell, tries all possible digits (1-9), and checks if placing a digit violates any Sudoku rules (row, column, or subgrid). If a digit is valid, the algorithm moves to the next empty cell and repeats the process. If a dead end is reached (i.e., no valid digits can be placed in the current cell), the algorithm backtracks to the previous cell and tries the next possible digit. This process continues until the board is completely and correctly filled or all possibilities are exhausted.</p>
              <p>The code below shows various function prototypes need to be implemented. A brief comment against each prototype describes what the function is supposed to do. The main program shows how the function is supposed to be used. You may want to test your program on more inputs.</p>
