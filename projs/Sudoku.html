            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Sudoku is a puzzle game played on a 9x9 board, divided into nine 3x3 subgrids. The goal is to fill the board with digits from 1 to 9 so that each digit appears exactly once in every row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. The puzzle begins with some cells already filled, and the player's task is to fill in the empty cells while following these rules, ensuring no repetition of digits in any row, column, or subgrid.</p>

            <p>For our purposes, each cell on the board will either contain a digit from 1 to 9 or a '.' representing an empty cell. We aim to write a recursive program that receives a partially filled initial state and attempts to reach a fully filled final state that satisfies all the Sudoku rules.</p>

                <p><strong>Solution Search Space:</strong> 
                The solution search space is the set of all possible configurations that could solve a problem. In Sudoku, it includes every potential way to fill the grid with digits 1-9, regardless of whether the configurations follow the Sudoku rules.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Exhaustive Search:</strong> 
                Exhaustive search explores all possible options within the solution search space to find a solution. For Sudoku, this involves trying every combination of numbers until a valid solution is found, but it can be time-consuming due to the large number of possibilities. Typical applications of exhaustive search include solving puzzles like Sudoku, generating permutations and combinations, and finding brute-force solutions to computationally hard problems such as the traveling salesman problem.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Backtracking:</strong> 
                Backtracking is a recursive technique that explores possible solutions by making choices and undoing them if they lead to dead ends. In Sudoku, backtracking places a number in a cell and, if it leads to an invalid configuration, reverses the decision and tries a different number. It is part of the core structure of a recursive algorithm and allows it to navigate through a solution space.</p>

          <div class="task1" id="task1">
              <h2>Task 1: Solve a 9x9 Sudoku board</h2>
              <p>Our first goal is to write a recursive exhaustive search algorithm to find a solution to a partially filled Sudoku board.</p>
              <h3>Brief explanation of the algorithm:</h3>
              <p>The algorithm works by recursively attempting to place a valid digit in each empty cell. It starts from the first empty cell, tries all possible digits (1-9), and checks if placing a digit violates any Sudoku rules (row, column, or subgrid). If a digit is valid, the algorithm moves to the next empty cell and repeats the process. If a dead end is reached (i.e., no valid digits can be placed in the current cell), the algorithm backtracks to the previous cell and tries the next possible digit. This process continues until the board is completely and correctly filled or all possibilities are exhausted.</p>
              <p>The code below shows various function prototypes to be implemented. A brief comment against each prototype describes what the function is supposed to do. The main program shows how the functions are to be used. You may want to test your program on more inputs.</p>

                    <p><strong>State:</strong> A specific configuration of the problem at a given moment. In the context of Sudoku, a state refers to the current arrangement of digits on the Sudoku board, including both filled and empty cells.</p>
                    <p><strong>State transition:</strong> The process of moving from one configuration of the problem to one of the valid next states. In the context of Sudoku, a state transition occurs when a digit is placed in an empty cell, altering the board to a valid next state.</p>
                    <p><strong>Goal state:</strong> The final configuration in a problem-solving process, where all constraints are satisfied (e.g., a fully solved Sudoku board).</p>
                    <p><strong>Heuristic function:</strong> A function, often denoted as h(n), that estimates the cost or distance from a given state to the goal state, guiding the search algorithm toward more promising paths.</p>
                </fieldset>
          </div>

           <div class="task2" id="task2">
              <h2>Task 2: Implement heuristics</h2>
                <p>In exhaustive search, we could be searching in subtrees that will not ultimately lead to a solution (goal state). This can be highly inefficient as it wastes time exploring paths that don't contribute to finding the correct answer.</p>

                <p>Heuristics can be used to prioritize subtrees (or paths) that are more likely to lead to a solution based on common-sense rules or educated guesses. By applying these heuristics, the search process is likely to become less wasteful by focusing on more promising paths, even though wasteful execution, and in particular the worst-case scenario, are still possible.</p>
                
                <p>The input of a heuristic function h(n) is a potential next state (or child state) n that can be reached directly from the current state by making a single move; such as, in case of Sudoku, by placing a valid number in the board. The output of the function is an estimate of the cost or distance from this child state to a goal state. This estimate helps guide the search algorithm in choosing which child node to explore next.</p>
                
                <p>Now, we will introduce two heuristics that could be useful for Sudoku.</p>

                <div class="heuristic1" id="heuristic1">
                    <h3>Minimum remaining values (MRV) heuristic</h3>

                    <p>The Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) heuristic improves the efficiency of a Sudoku solver by selecting the cell with the fewest legal options available. In other words, the most constrained cell. The intuition here is that since a few options are left for this cell one of them is likely to be part of a goal state.</p>
                    
                    <p>Write another version of the solveSudoku method called solveSudokuMRV. Also, write functions countMRV and hMRV. The prototypes of these functions are shown below with brief explanations in comments:</p>

                    <div class="code-container" data-filename="./cpp/sudoku2.cpp">
                        <pre>
                             <code class="language-cpp" id="cpp-code2"></code>
                        </pre>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>These functions help implement the MRV heuristic in the Sudoku solver, making the algorithm more efficient by focusing on the most constrained cells first.</p>
            
                    <p>Use the solveSudokuMRV function in the main and compare the number of recusrive calls it makes with those made in the basic backtracking code. Is there a reduction in the number of calls?</p>

                </div>

               <div class="heuristic2" id="heuristic2">
                   <h3>Least constraining value (LCV) heuristic</h3>
                   <p>While the MRV heuristic look to fill the most constrained cells first, the LCV works by choosing the value which, when placed in a selected cell (selected randomly or via MRV), leaves the most options open for other cells. Intuitively, this heuristic reduces the likelihood of creating further constraints down the line, helping to avoid dead-ends and excessive backtracking.</p>
                   <p>Note that when a value is placed in a cell, it only reduces the number of the options of the impacted cells by 1 each. Here the impacted cells are those in the same row, column and subgrid of the selected cell. However, the impact of a placement goes beyond this. For example, placing a specific number in a cell may highly constrain a nearby, almost filled subgrid. So, in LCV, we select a value which keeps the number of available options for all other empty cells in the grid to maximum possible.</p>
                   <p>Following snippet shows prototypes of functions you need to add (feel free to add more utility functions is required). As before, compare the number of recusrive calls made by <code>solveSodukuLCV</code> with those made by the basic backtracking method.</p>
