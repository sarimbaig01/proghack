        <h1>Problem 3.1 Partitioning Data</h1>
        <section class="statement">
            <h2 class="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Partitioning data around an element is a common operation used in several fundamental algorithms in
                computer science. Given a vector of integers, \( A \), of size \( N \), and an index \( p \) between 0
                and
                \( N - 1 \), partitioning involves rearranging the elements of \( A \) such that all elements with
                indices
                \( i \) where \( 0 \leq i < N \) are divided into two groups: those less than or equal to \( A[p] \)
                    (the pivot) are placed on one side, and those greater than \( A[p] \) are placed on the other side.
                    The element \( A[p] \) is referred to as the pivot. </p>

                    <h3>Examples</h3>

                    <p>Let A = [9, 3, 7, 6, 2, 8, 1, 4, 5, 10] with pivot index p = 2 (pivot = 7).</p>

                    <p><strong>Original:</strong><br><br>
                        A = [9, 3, 7, 6, 2, 8, 1, 4, 5, 10]</p>

                    <p><strong>All of the following partitions are valid:</strong></p>

                    <p>A = [1, 3, 2, 5, 6, 4, 7, 9, 10, 8]</p>

                    <p>A = [6, 2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 7, 10, 8, 9]</p>

                    <p>A = [4, 1, 5, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 8]</p>

                    <p>In all these cases, the elements less than or equal to the pivot (7) are on the left, while the
                        elements
                        greater than 7 are on the right, though their relative order differs.</p>

                    <h3>Requirements</h3>
                    <p>The goal is often to partition the data <strong>in-place</strong>. This means that the data is
                        rearranged
                        directly within the original structure, reducing memory overhead. By doing so, algorithms can be
                        more
                        efficient, especially when handling large datasets, as no extra space is required for a copy of
                        the
                        data, and three is no need to allocate/deallocate additional memory, which will slow down the
                        program.
                    </p>

                    <h4>An in-place method</h4>
                    <p>Following is a description of a method for in-place partition. The description is
                        deliberately kept at a high level; details need to be worked out.</p>

                    <div class="text-box">
                        <p><strong>In-place partition using two indices</strong></p>

                        <p>Keep an index \( l \) (left) on the left side, and an index \( r \) (right), on the right
                            side of
                            the vector, \( A \).</p>
                        <p>Determine if \( A[l] \) and \( A[r] \) should be swapped, based on the value of the pivot.
                        </p>
                        (Be careful regarding where \( l \) and \( r \) should begin, and when the loop should
                        terminate)
                        <p>Return the index of partition: the index \( k \), such that \( \forall i \, (i < k) \), \(
                                A[k] \leq \text{pivot} \), and \( \forall i \, (i> k) \), \( A[k] > \text{pivot} \).</p>
                    </div>


                    <p>The following code contains an empty function (to be implemented by you), and a main that tests
                        it.</p>
