            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>A perceptron is one of the simplest forms of artificial neural networks, designed to perform binary classification tasks. Inspired by the way biological neurons function, a perceptron takes multiple input signals, applies corresponding weights, sums them up, and passes the result through an activation function to produce an output. This output determines which class the input belongs to. A single-layer perceptron is the most basic form, but by stacking multiple layers of perceptrons, we can create multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) or more complex neural networks capable of solving a wide range of problems. The perceptron is used in supervised learning, where it learns from labeled data to make predictions. It forms the foundation for more complex neural network architectures and serves as a crucial building block in the field of machine learning.</p>
            <p>Examples of supervised learning tasks that could use a perceptron include medical diagnosis, where symptoms are used to determine whether a patient has a particular disease, and sentiment analysis, where text is classified as having positive or negative sentiment, etc.</p>
