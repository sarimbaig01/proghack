            <h2> Sparse Matrices </h2>
              <p>A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero, similar to how sparse polynomials contain mostly zero coefficients. Sparse matrices arise frequently in scientific computing, engineering, and data science, where large datasets or systems are represented with many zero values. For example, a sparse matrix could be a large system of linear equations where only a small portion of the equations have non-zero coefficients. Instead of storing all the zero elements, we can store only the non-zero values and their positions, leading to significant memory savings.</p>
              
              <p>A more space-efficient way to store sparse matrices is by using a linked list. In this approach, each node in the linked list stores the row index, column index, and the non-zero value of the matrix. For example, consider the following 5x5 sparse matrix:</p>
              
              <p>
              \[
              \begin{pmatrix}
              0 & 0 & 3 & 0 & 5 \\
              22 & 0 & 0 & 8 & 0 \\
              0 & 17 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
              0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 \\
              1 & 0 & 0 & 7 & 0
              \end{pmatrix}
              \]
              </p>
              
              <p>This matrix can be represented as the following linked list, where arrows represent the next pointers:</p>
              
              <p>head → (0, 2, 3) → (0, 4, 5) → (1, 0, 22) → (1, 3, 8) → (2, 1, 17) → (3, 4, 4) → (4, 0, 1) → (4, 3, 7) → NULL</p>
              
              <p>In this linked list-based representation, each node contains the row index, column index, and the non-zero value. By storing only the non-zero elements, this approach significantly reduces memory usage while still maintaining the important information needed for computations on the matrix.</p>

              <h2>Implementation</h2>
              <p>Following is a skeleton code that provides function prototypes and a main function to test various operations on sparse polynomials. The functions implement key operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, differentiation, and integration of polynomials. Feel free to add additional helper functions as needed to simplify the implementation of these operations. Ensure the functions are written as efficiently as possible.</p>
