    <h1>Rotated Maximum</h1>
  <section class="statement">
    <p>
      We know from binary search that we can find any key from a sorted vector in logarithmic time. This is done by repeatedly halving the size of the vector that needs to be searched in the next step after only looking at the central element in each step. The problem of finding the maximum in a sorted vector would be trivial as simply the last element could be returned. However, consider a vector whose contents have been rotated right an unknown number of times. How may you now find its maximum element in logarithmic time?
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> When we say logarithmic time, we mean that the algorithm takes a total of <strong>a log n + b</strong> basic operations to complete (where <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> are constants).

      Example inputs:
    </p>

    <p>
      The vector [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2] has been rotated 3 places to the right.<br>
      The vector [6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5] has been rotated 2 places to the right.<br>
      The vector [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] has not been rotated.<br>
      The vector [2, 3, 4, 5, 1] has been rotated 1 place to the right.<br>
      The vector [5, 1, 2, 3, 4] has been rotated 4 places to the right.
