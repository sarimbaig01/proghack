        <section class="statement">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This problem refers to the same network server as the previous problem. The server collects identifiers
                from various machines on the network and ensures the data is free of duplicates. However, if a machine
                has been offline throughout the communication period and doesn’t interact with the server, its
                identifier will be missing from the list. In such cases, the server needs to quickly detect which
                machine is missing to address the issue promptly.
            </p>

            <h3>Problem definition</h3>
            <p>
                We are given a vector <code>identifiers</code> of \( N = 2^d - 1 \) unique binary strings of length \( d
                \).
                Therefore one of the \(2^d\) possible identifiers is missing. The identifiers are not necessarily in the
                sorted order.</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>The goal is to find the identifier of the missing machine.</p>
            <p>
                For example:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Input:</strong> identifiers = {"110", "101", "011", "111", "001", "000", "100"}<br>
                <strong>Output:</strong> The identifier of the missing machine = "010"
            </p>

            <p>
                Some notes: solving this problem may not require sorting the strings first. Moreover, you might be able
                to do this without using any additional memory, except for a few variables.
            </p>


            <p>Design and implement a solution in C++. The following code provides an empty function
                (to be implemented by you), and a main that tests it.</p>
            <div class="code-container" data-filename="./cpp/missing_mach1.cpp">
                <pre><code class="language-cpp" id="cpp-code1">
                </code></pre>
            </div>

            <h2>Missing Machine(s)</h2>

            <p>In another version of the problem, the server does not preprocess the data. All received identifiers,
                including duplicates, are kept in the identifiers list. Additionally, more than one machine might be
                offline and fail to communicate with the server, leading to multiple missing identifiers. The task
                is to report all the missing identifiers.</p>

            <h3>Problem definition</h3>
            <p>
                We are given a vector <code>identifiers</code> of \( N \) binary strings of length \( d
                \) each, possibly containing duplicates.
                The identifiers are not necessarily in the sorted order.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>The goal is to report the identifiers of all missing machines.</p>
