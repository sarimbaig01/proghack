        <h1 class="align-with-statement">Problem 2.1 Data Relaying in Sensor Networks</h1>
        <section class="statement">

            <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                A <strong>linear network of temperature sensors</strong> has been deployed along a pipeline. These
                sensors are designed to monitor temperature variations and detect anomalies.
            </p>
            <p>
                The network aims to relay temperature readings from the <strong>first sensor</strong> (at position 0) to
                the <strong>last sensor</strong> (at position \(n-1\)). Each sensor has a limited communication range,
                defining how far its data can travel directly to other sensors in the network.
            </p>
            <p>
                The objective is to determine if it is possible to transmit temperature data from the first sensor to
                the last sensor by relaying through intermediate sensors.
            </p>

            <h3>Part 1: Reachability</h3>
            <p>
                We are given an integer vector <code>ranges</code>, where each element \(ranges[i]\) represents the
                communication range of the \(i\)-th sensor.
            </p>
            <p>
                The task is to determine if it is possible to relay temperature data from the first sensor to the last
                sensor.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Expected Output:</strong><br>
                The function should return:
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>true</strong>: If it is possible to transmit temperature data from the first sensor to the
                last sensor.<br>
                <strong>false</strong>: If it is not possible to relay data to the last sensor.
            </p>

            <h4>Examples</h4>
            <table class="example-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Example</th>
                        <th>Input (<code>ranges</code>)</th>
                        <th>Output</th>
                        <th>Explanation</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>1</strong></td>
                        <td>[2, 3, 1, 1, 4]</td>
                        <td>true</td>
                        <td>
                            The first sensor (index 0) can send data to sensors at indices 1 and 2. From sensor 1,
                            the data can hop directly to sensor 4. Therefore, it is possible to transmit data to the
                            last sensor using sensors 0, 1, and 4.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>2</strong></td>
                        <td>[3, 2, 1, 0, 4]</td>
                        <td>false</td>
                        <td>
                            The first sensor can send data to sensors up to index 3, but sensor 3 has a
                            communication range of 0. This makes it impossible to relay data to the last sensor. <br>
                            (Note: if there are no zero range sensors, the last sensor is always reachable. The question
                            of
                            reachability is interesting when there are some zeros.)
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>The following code provides an empty function (to be implemented by you), and a main that tests it.</p>

            <h3>Part 2: The Minimum Relay Path</h3>
            <p>
                We wish to not only find if data can be relayed to the last sensor, but also, in case data can
                be relayed, wish to known the minimum relay path (the one involving the least number of sensors) that
                data can follow from the first to the last sensor. In this task, we may
                assume that the path exists (i.e., <code>can_relay</code> has returned true for the given input).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Expected Output:</strong><br>
                The function should return:
            </p>
            <p>
                A vector containing the indices of the sensors used in the relaying process, in order.
            </p>
