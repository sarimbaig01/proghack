    <h1> Problem 1.3 Temperature Trends </h1>
        <section class="statement">
           <p>As a data analyst for an environmental research company, you need to identify periods of sustained temperature increase from sensor data collected over time. This time, however, the focus is on detecting the longest periods of increasing temperatures—not necessarily contiguous readings—where each reading is higher than the previous one. These periods represent sustained warming trends, capturing general patterns that persist even amidst daily fluctuations (which could include noise). By identifying these stretches of increase, researchers can gain insights into prolonged warming phases that may not be evident when only considering cumulative sums of temperature values (as sums could turn out to be high due to outliers, for example).</p>

            <p>Your task is to determine the longest, not necessarily contiguous, sequence of increasing temperature readings in the data. This sequence will help detect periods of sustained warming, and will be particularly useful for longer inputs.</p>

            <h3>A Visual Example</h3>
            <p>The plots below show three different longest sequences of rising tempteratures detected from the same input. A longer rising trend is not present in the input. <strong>In our task we interested only in finding the length of this longest sequence, or trend, which in this case is 10.</p>
            <div class="multi-image-container">
                    <figure style="display: inline-block; margin: 10px; text-align: center;">
                        <img src="./img/TempTrends1.png" width="300" height="300"/>
                        <img src="./img/TempTrends2.png" width="300" height="300"/>
                        <img src="./img/TempTrends3.png" width="300" height="300"/>
                    <figcaption>Figure 1: Plots show three different longest sequences of rising tempteratures detected from the same input. Each has length 10. Our program's output in this case should be 10: the length of the trend.</figure>

            <h3>Further examples of inputs and outputs:</h3>

            Some example inputs and their corresponding outputs are shown below:

            <p><strong>Input:</strong> data = [5, 2, 8, 6, 3, 6, 9, 5]</p>
            <p><strong>Output:</strong> Longest trend length = 4</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The longest increasing trend is [2, 3, 6, 9], which has a length of 4.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Input:</strong> data = [1, 7, 3, 5, 9, 2, 8, 6]</p>
            <p><strong>Output:</strong> Longest trend length = 4</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The longest increasing trend is [1, 3, 5, 9], or [1, 3, 5, 8], or [1, 3, 5, 6], each of which has length 4.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Input:</strong> data = [3, 10, 2, 1, 20]</p>
            <p><strong>Output:</strong> Longest trend length = 3</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The longest increasing trend is [3, 10, 20], which has a length of 3.</p>

            <h3>Python code</h3>
            <p>Implement the following function stub: </p>
            <div class="code-container" data-filename="./py/temptrend1.py">
                <pre><code class="language-python" id="py-code">
                </code></pre>
            </div>
         
            <p>Use the following main to test your function: </p>
            <div class="code-container" data-filename="./py/temptrend2.py">
                <pre><code class="language-python" id="py-code">
