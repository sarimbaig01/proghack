            <h2>What is the game of life?</h2>  
            <p>Conway's Game of Life is a <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cellular-automata/" target="_blank">cellular automaton</a> devised by mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway" target="_blank">John Horton Conway</a> in 1970. It's a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state without any further input. The game is played on an infinite grid of square cells, each of which can be either <i>alive</i> or <i>dead</i>. The state of the grid evolves in discrete time steps according to a set of simple rules based on the states of neighboring cells. Despite simple rules, the Game of Life can produce incredibly complex and varied patterns, being used in practical applications such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01398" target="_blank">neural networks research</a> in computer science and <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aapt/ajp/article/91/7/561/2897367/The-game-of-life-as-a-species-model" target="_blank">simulating population dynamics</a> in theoretical biology, among other applications.</p>

              <p><strong>Cell</strong>: The basic unit in the grid, either alive or dead.</p>

              <h2>The rules</h2>
                <p>Conway's Game of Life typically uses the B3/S23 rules, which are the most common despite many possible variations. "B3/S23" means a dead cell with exactly three alive neighbors becomes alive (B3), and a live cell with two or three alive neighbors survives (S23). The rules are:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Any live cell with fewer than two alive neighbors dies (the underpopulation rule).</li>
                  <li>A live cell with two or three alive neighbors survives (the survival rule). (</li>
                  <li>Any live cell with more than three alive neighbors dies (the overcrowding rule).</li>
                  <li>A dead cell with exactly three alive neighbors becomes alive (the reproduction rule).</li>
                </ol>

             <h2>The task and boilerplate code</h2>
             <p>
                 Consider the following simulation of Conway's Game of Life. This simulation uses a 100x100 grid, which is a useful size because it balances complexity and manageability, allowing intricate patterns to emerge without overwhelming computational resources. In this grid, black cells represent alive states, while white cells represent dead states. The initial configuration of the grid is populated randomly with a mix of alive and dead cells. Our first goal is to write code that can produce such simulations, showing the evolution of this grid over any number of generations, continuing until the window is closed by the user.
