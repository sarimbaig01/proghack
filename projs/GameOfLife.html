           <h3>What is the game of life?</h3>
           <p>Conway's Game of Life is a <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cellular-automata/" target="_blank">cellular automaton</a> devised by mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway" target="_blank">John Horton Conway</a> in 1970. It's a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state without any further input. The game is played on an infinite grid of square cells, each of which can be either <i>alive</i> or <i>dead</i>. The state of the grid evolves in discrete time steps according to a set of simple rules based on the states of neighboring cells. Despite simple rules, the Game of Life can produce incredibly complex and varied patterns, being used in practical applications such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01398" target="_blank">neural networks research</a> in computer science and <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aapt/ajp/article/91/7/561/2897367/The-game-of-life-as-a-species-model" target="_blank">simulating population dynamics</a> in theoretical biology, among other applications.</p>

                  <p><strong>Cell</strong>: The basic unit in the grid, either alive or dead.</p>
                  <p><strong>Grid</strong>: The environment where the Game of Life is played, consisting of cells in a two-dimensional array.</p>
                  <p><strong>Alive</strong>: A cell state that is "on" or active, represented by `1`.</p>
                  <p><strong>Dead</strong>: A cell state that is "off" or inactive, represented by `0`.</p>
                  <p><strong>Generation</strong>: A time step where the state of each cell is updated based on the game's rules.</p>
                  <p><strong>Neighbor</strong>: Any of the eight surrounding cells influencing a cell's future state.</p>
                  <p><strong>Initial Configuration</strong>: The starting arrangement of alive and dead cells in the grid.</p>
