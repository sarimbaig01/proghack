        <section class="statement">
           <p>Conway's Game of Life is a <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cellular-automata/" target="_blank">cellular automaton</a> devised by mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway" target="_blank">John Horton Conway</a> in 1970. It's a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state without any further input. The game is played on an infinite grid of square cells, each of which can be either <i>alive</i> or <i>dead</i>. The state of the grid evolves in discrete time steps according to a set of simple rules based on the states of neighboring cells. Despite simple rules, the Game of Life can produce incredibly complex and varied patterns, being used in practical applications such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01398" target="_blank">neural network design</a> and <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aapt/ajp/article/91/7/561/2897367/The-game-of-life-as-a-species-model" target="_blank">simulating population dynamics</a> in theoretical biology, among other applications.</p>
