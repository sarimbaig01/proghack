          <p>HeapifyUp, heapifyDown, insert, removeMin, and getMin are the standard methods belonging to the Heap Abstract Data Type (ADT). An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a model for a certain data structure that specifies the type of data it can hold, along with the operations that can be performed on it, without specifying how these operations will be implemented.</p>

            <p>However, there are several other functionalities that can be added to a Binary Min-Heap, which can prove to be useful for other algorithms, such as those used for sorting, shortest path finding, and scheduling, to name a few areas. Four of the most commonly used additional functionalities that can augment heap functionality are as follows:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Update Key</strong>: Changes the value of a specific heap node, either increasing or decreasing it, and restores the heap property. This is useful for dynamically updating priorities in various algorithms. The updateKey operation should take time logarithmic in the size of the input, \( N \).</li>
                <li><strong>Merge (Union) Heaps</strong>: Combines two heaps into one while maintaining the heap property. Useful in applications that require merging of priority queues. The union operation should take time linear in \( N \).</li>
                <li><strong>Delete</strong>: Removes any specific element from the heap and restores the heap property. Useful for dynamically managing tasks in scheduling. The delete operation should take time logarithmic in the size of the input, \( N \).</li>
                <li><strong>heapSort</strong>: Sorts any given vector with random values by building a heap and repeatedly removing the minimum element. Useful for sorting data efficiently. The heapSort operation might take time proportional to \( N \log N \).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Following are the required prototypes of these functions followed by a main program to be used for testing the functions.</p>
